ttyrant - Tokyo Tyrant binary protocol binding for haxe/neko.

http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/tyrantdoc/

To Build:
Download caffeine-hx http://code.google.com/p/caffeine-hx/
    The binding depends on math.BigInteger and openssl.ndll for some methods.
    And math.BigInteger's toInt method needs to be set to public.


Tests:
    Checkout the tests/TyrantTest.hx for examples of usage. 

    To run the tests successfully, run: 
    cd tests
    ./setup_test_run
    ttserver -port 19789 -ext test.lua -ulog test_run/ulog -sid 1 test_run/casket.tch
    haxe compile.hxml 

    Cleaning up test_run data:
    cd tests
    ./clean_test_run

There are comments in ttyrant/Connection.hx for method documentation, and the Tokyo Tyrant docs 
further explain the methods.

ttyrant was built and tested on Ubuntu 8.10.  Before building the tests be sure to make
a symlink to caffeine-hx in this directory.

Some methods have not been thoroughly tested yet, so proceed with caution on important data.
