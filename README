ttyrant - Tokyo Tyrant binary protocol binding for haxe/neko.

http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/tyrantdoc/

To Build:
Download caffeine-hx http://code.google.com/p/caffeine-hx/
    The binding depends on math.BigInteger and openssl.ndll for some methods.
    And math.BigInteger's toInt method needs to be set to public.

Checkout the tests directory for examples of usage. 
There are comments in ttyrant/Connection.hx for method documentation, and the Tokyo Tyrant docs 
further explain the methods.

ttyrant was built and tested on Ubuntu 8.10.  Before building the tests be sure to make
a symlink to caffeine-hx in this directory.

Some methods have not been thoroughly tested yet, so proceed with caution on important data.
